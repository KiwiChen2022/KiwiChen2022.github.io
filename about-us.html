            Kurahara Kakeru runs through the city streets at night. A single man chases after him on a bicycle. That man's name is Kiyose Haiji. When Haiji catches up to Kakeru, he asks him a question: "Hey, do you like running?" Led by Haiji, Kakeru arrives at the Chikusei-so student dorm. He meets the strange residents living there. Haiji behaves in a peremptory manner. Kakeru is bewildered by the sudden development. No one at the dorm is aware of Haiji's ulterior motive. That night, the residents hold a welcoming party for Kakeru. At the party, from Haiji's mouth comes a grand and reckless plan.</td></tr>

            The residents of the Chikusei-so will run in the Hakone Ekiden together. Kakeru responds strongly to Haiji's rash suggestion. All the residents are amateurs when it comes to long distance running. Nobody takes Haiji's words seriously. The residents attempt to carry on with their college lives, but Haiji's shadow approaches. Threatened by Haiji's mysterious pressure, several tragically fall to Haiji's hand. Kakeru tries to leave the Chikusei-so, but he runs into Nico-chan in the city. Meanwhile, the Chikusei-so's bath breaks for unknown reasons, and they decide to go to the "hellish" public bath instead.</td></tr>

            When their hot water contest ends in a tie, Kakeru participates in the dorm's morning jogs while continuing to rebel against Haiji. His plan is to make the other residents give up. The next morning, several of the residents decide to boycott the jogging. A young girl wearing a school uniform runs up to Kakeru and his cool attitude. Hana-chan is introduced to the team.

            "It's been a while..." Sakaki smirks fearlessly. He and Kakeru are old acquaintances. Kakeru is unable to hide how shaken he is by their unexpected reunion. Swirling inside Kakeru was the loneliness he experienced as a high school student due to his talents. Kakeru runs as though fleeing from shadows, when before him appears "the other Kakeru." It is the desperate man he used to be before he met Haiji. Kakeru glares resentfully at his past. Just as he's about to lose hope in himself, someone with a kind voice reaches out to him. It's Prince and his friends.</td></tr>

            After being challenged by Tokyo Sport University's Sakaki, Kakeru and the other residents of Chikusei-so have grown closer. As they celebrate the renewal of their resolve, King comes home wearing a suit for a change. Meanwhile, Kakeru voices his objections to participating in a track meet so soon. What point is there in forcing the amateurish residents to face reality? In response to Kakeru, Haiji asks his own question. Kakeru's doubts remain unresolved as Haiji begins holding proper practices. However, King refuses to participate because he's busy looking for a job.

Meanwhile, Kakeru goes to Nico-chan in order to dispel his doubts about Haiji, but he's unable to find a definitive answer.

Desperate to do something about Prince, Kakeru follows him around while nagging him. Prince's opposition increases in response. However, Kakeru manages to help Prince by learning to see things as he does. As the residents are unable to even feed themselves, Hana comes to extend a helping hand.</td></tr>

Meanwhile, the stagnating Shindo and Yuki utilize their strengths to make a strong effort towards achieving an official time. During the final lap, Haiji's words cut through Kakeru's mind. "Do you like running?" In that moment, something inside him opens, and Kakeru bangs out an astonishing time. After the race, a lone reporter approaches Kakeru, and the mysterious man with the camera introduces himself to the boys as Shinjitsu Weekly's Shuji Mochizuki. Mr. Mochizuki seems to know that Kakeru was part of a track team of a prestigious high school. Haiji takes the whole group to Lake Shirakaba for a training camp. Tokyo Sport Uni also happens to be there at the same location.  Haiji continues to encourage Kakeru with training advice.

Later they begin their grueling practice, but Kakeru can't stop recalling heavy memories from his high school days: a cruel past that pushed a group of elite runners to their breaking point.

            Sakaki's fighting spirit verges on tragic. As though dragged along by it, King loses his pace. He thinks back on a conversation he had once with Haiji. The words he can't say, the reality he can't escape. King's thoughts eventually arrive at the day he arrived at Chikusei-so. It was the beginning of a lonely but dream-like time. That small discouragement, that small pride. Carry all of it with you as you run. The men continue to fight to find themselves.</td></tr>

            Kakeru is bewildered by this new experience. His speed overwhelms the other competitors. Meanwhile, Rikudo's ace Fujioka breaks the section record as promised and pushes his team into 1st place. Eventually, Kakeru finishes his section and beats Fujioka's newly set record by 1 second. Haiji begins the final section of the Hakone Ekiden. In order for Kansei University to make the top 10, Haiji must race to beat Tokyo Sport University by a significant margin. He struggles throughout his run and in the last stretch feels a sharp pain from his injured knee. Seeing Kakeru at the finish line, he pushes through and finishes in time for Kansei University to come in 10th, giving them a seed for the next year's race. Three years pass and each member has gone on to find their way.</td></tr>
